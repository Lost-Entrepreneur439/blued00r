<h1>Welcome to my Cydia repo!</h1>
<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Ella, this is my Cydia repo, which I mainly use to rehost tweaks required for Blued00r that are on a dead repo, hence the name of the repo. I do not know how to program so I do not make tweaks, however I will make an Anemone theme every now and then. Don't expect much from me though. You can find me on Reddit as u/Lost-Entrepreneur439, and I'm also pretty active on the Legacy Jailbreak Discord server.</p>
